# About PrivacyHub

**PrivacyHub** is an open-source project dedicated to promoting transparency and understanding of privacy policies across various websites and apps. By crowdsourcing evaluations based on a clear rubric, we aim to provide users with a comprehensive score that reflects the privacy practices of different online services.

## Objective

The primary objective of PrivacyHub is to display a score derived from the evaluation of privacy policies of various websites and apps. This score is based on a predefined rubric that assesses different aspects of a privacy policy, such as data handling, transparency, and data collection practices.

## Rubric and Point System

Our rubric will evaluate privacy policies based on the following criteria:

-   **Handling**
    
    -   Personally-targeted or behavioural marketing: 4/10
    -   Permanent deletion of personal data: 5/5
    -   Third-party access to private personal data: 0/10
    -   Law enforcement access to personal data: 3/5
-   **Transparency**
    
    -   General security practices outlined: 2/3
    -   Policy's history availability: 5/5
    -   Notification requirement in case of a data breach: 0/7
    -   Notification to users when policy is meaningfully changed: 0/5
-   **Collection**
    
    -   Collection of personal data from third parties: 0/10
    -   Clarity on why personal data is collected: 7/10
    -   Control over non-critical personal data collection or use: 3/10
    -   Listing of personal data collected: 7/10


## Technology Stack Recommendations

For the development and deployment of PrivacyHub, we are utilizing a lightweight and efficient technology stack:

-   **Backend**: Conversion from TOML to HTML. This allows us to maintain structured data in TOML format and then dynamically generate the corresponding HTML content.
    
-   **Frontend**: The user interface is built using standard web technologies:
    
    -   HTML for structuring the content.
    -   JavaScript for dynamic interactions and functionality.
    -   CSS for styling and layout.
-   **Hosting & Deployment**: The entire project is hosted on GitHub, leveraging the simplicity and efficiency of GitHub Pages or Netlify for deployment. This ensures easy collaboration, version control, and seamless updates to the live site.
